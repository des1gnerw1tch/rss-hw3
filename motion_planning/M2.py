    Parameters
    ----------
    robot : Robot
        our pybullet robot class
    num_samples : int
        number of samples in PRM
    num_neighbors : int
        number of closest neighbors to consider in PRM

    Returns

    typing.Tuple[np.array, Graph]
        np.array: 
            num_samples x 4 numpy array, sampled configurations in the roadmap (vertices)
        G: 
            a NetworkX graph object with weighted edges indicating the distance between connected nodes in the joint configuration space.
            This should be impelemented as an undirected graph.
