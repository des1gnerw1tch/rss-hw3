    ----------
    robot : Robot
        our robot object
    samples : np.array
        num_samples x 4 numpy array of nodes/vertices in the roadmap
    G : Graph
        An undirected NetworkX graph object with the number of nodes equal to num_samples,

    q_start : np.array
        1x4 numpy array denoting the start configuration
    q_goal : np.array
       1x4 numpy array denoting the goal configuration
